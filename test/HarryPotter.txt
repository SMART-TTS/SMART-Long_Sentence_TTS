It is nighttime in surrey, we see two owls on the street sign privet drive and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. One the owls fly away to reveal a elderly man with crimson robes, and the long silvery white beard named albus dumbledore walks through a forest near the street. He takes out his deliminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge. I should have known that you would be here professor mcgonagall. The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. We see that the cats shadow progressing into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGongall is revealed. Good evening, professor dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus. I am afraid so, professor. The good, and the bad. And the boy. Hagrid is bringing him. Do you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this. Ah, professor, I would trust hagrid with my life. There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named rubeus hagrid, takes off his goggles. Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore. Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people. I have watched them all day. They are the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. The only family he has. They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive. This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesnt know his name. Exactly Hes better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready. Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat. Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The films title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time. The scars glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs. She knocks on his closet door repeatedly Now. Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase. Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone. Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes. Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon. Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares. Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him. At the London Zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large Boa constructor. Vernon taps the glass of the cage. Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces. Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake. The now awake snake has attracted Dudleys attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor. Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance. Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry. The snake slivers off to the exit. There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped, he pounds the glass in panic. Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harrys grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon. Back at the Dursleys, Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in. They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair. Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses roof. The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy. Vernon, just look at him. I cant believe it. In just a week you will be off to Smeltings. Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept.
